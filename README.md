# Python Project: Webscraping NBA Website Data for Bar Graph Presentation
This project demonstrates webscraping data from the NBA website that will be displayed on a bar graph.
The data extracted represents the top 5 teams in assist totals for a specified year determined by the user.
The resulting data will be presented in an internet browser.

# Requirements
## Requests:
```
$ python -m pip install requests
```

## Plotly Express:

Data prior to the 1995-96 cannot be retrieved as the NBA website does not provide this data.
Video data prior to 2015-16 cannot be retrieved due to the same issue.
